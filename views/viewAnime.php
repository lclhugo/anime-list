                <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
                <p>It is the far future, in the year 2345 of a new calendar - two thousand years, that is, after the
                    dawn of
                    the
                    space age. After centuries of peace, the people of Earth have lost the technology they once
                    possessed
                    and
                    forgotten that they once traveled in space. But a lost tribe of lunar settlers, the Moonrace, have
                    retained the
                    scientific arts... and now they regard their mother planet with envious eyes.<br />
                    <br />
                    Hoping to return to their ancestral home, the Moonrace contact Earth's feudal lords and attempt to
                    negotiate the
                    transfer of a chunk of the planet's territory. But soon, unable to make a deal with Earth's rulers,
                    the
                    Moonrace
                    decide to seize the land they desire by force. Anticipating an extraterrestrial invasion, Earth's
                    feudal
                    lords
                    organize militias armed with cars and biplanes to do battle with the Moonrace's army of giant
                    two-legged
                    war
                    machines.<br />
                    <br />
                    Caught in the middle of this war of the worlds is a youth named Loran
                    Cehack, who finds a mysterious artifact - a relic of Earth's
                    forgotten space age - entombed in stone. Will this ancient mobile suit enable Loran to avert the
                    conflict and
                    make peace between Earth and Moon?<br />
